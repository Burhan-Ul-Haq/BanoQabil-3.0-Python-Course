Real-World Problem:
This is a Password Strength Checker, 
Sometimes there is a need to check if your Password is strong, so this program helps do the task with the help of its conditions which check if user-entered passwords contain all the conditions if not the user is prompted by 'Your Password isn't strong enough'

Logic:
The program runs a ‘for’ loop with char which checks each character one by one in the User-entered Password, Example: When the Digits condition comes to check whether the Password has a digit or not so the for loop runs by checking if the first character of the Password is a digit or not, if not it runs to the second character of the Password and does it until it doesn’t find a digit to set the condition to ‘True’ if it doesn’t find any digit then it returns an error
